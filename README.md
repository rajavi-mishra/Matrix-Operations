# numc

Here's what I did in project 4:
Rajavi wrote the code for Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3 as well as debugged it when needed. Vihaan decided to PNP, therefore did not contribute much. He debugged some lines of code for Task 1.

So I did this project in the order of task 1, task 2, and task 3. While doing task 3, I initially implemented subscript function differently. I was calling subscript in set_subscript. However, after reading Piazza and running into segmentation fault (although all tests were passing except set), I realized that it would be better to create a helper function that could be called from subscript and set_subscript. This approach proved to be much effective and enabled me to fix the segmentation fault.

Thank you to TAs on Piazza and OH. I would not have been able to do the project without their support. Thank to professor Garcia, Connor and Stephan for granting me 2 days of extension.
